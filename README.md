# product-landing-page

This is a project challenge that I made for freeCodeCamp. Main objective is to make a responsive web design. I love animals so I created a product landing page on a fictional company/brand that rescues pets, arranges foster and adoption and clinical services. 

This project composes of pure HTMl and CSS. I'll be adding on the interactiveness of the webpage a bit later. 

The video embedded on this repo is totally insignificant to the product landing page so you may just ignore it.
